Railway is one of the most reliable modes of transport. It can be used for
transportation of all sorts of cargo at any weather conditions. Railway transport is
particularly attractive for delivery of considerable volumes of goods for long
distances.
We also offer delivery of smaller batches of cargo. Itâ€™s less expensive than airfreight
and significantly faster than ocean freight. This is expedited delivery from China by
rail in special container trains.
