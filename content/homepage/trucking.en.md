International road transport is the most versatile and efficient transportation way for any type of cargo: oversize, dangerous, valuable and even perishable. 

Thanks to long time cooperation with a wide number of truckers we deliver various types of consolidated cargo (LTL) and full truck loads (FTL) to and from Western and Central Europe, Scandinavia, Turkey and other countries of Middle East, CIS and Baltic states.
