Railway is one of the most reliable modes of transport. 

It can be used for transportation of all sorts of cargo at any weather conditions. 

Railway transport is particularly attractive for delivery of considerable volumes of goods for long distances.

We also offer delivery of smaller batches of cargo. Itâ€™s less expensive than airfreight and significantly faster than ocean freight. This is expedited delivery from China by rail in special container trains.
